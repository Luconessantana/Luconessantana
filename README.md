     so that there is equality for this new beginning. help people to have this knowledge, using crypto coins, for a better future for all.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning I am studying in information technology management,
      with the objective of being an information security manager, so that my project reaches everyone equally

      working voluntarily to establish equality in the needy places I go, in every possible way. I am currently a volunteer in Rio de Janeiro-Brazil.
